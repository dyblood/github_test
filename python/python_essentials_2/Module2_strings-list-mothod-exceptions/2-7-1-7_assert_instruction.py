# 2.7.1.7 - Exceptions: assert instruction

# assert expression:
    # it evaluates the expression
    # if the expression evaluates to True, or a non-zero numerical value, 
        # or a non-empty string, or any other value different than None, 
        # it won't do anything else;
    # otherwise, it automatically and immediately raises an exception named AssertionError
        # (in this case, we say that the assertion has failed)
