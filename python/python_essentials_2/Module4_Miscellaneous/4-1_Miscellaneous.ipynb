    "\n",
    "A Python generator is a piece of specialized code able to produce a series of values, and to control the iteration process. This is why generators are very often called iterators, and although some may find a very subtle distinction between these two, we'll treat them as one.\n",

    "\n",
    "A function returns one, well-defined value - it may be the result of a more or less complex evaluation of, e.g., a polynomial, and is invoked once - only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "A generator returns a series of values, and in general, is (implicitly) invoked more than once.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example, the range() generator is invoked six times, providing five subsequent values from zero to four, and finally signaling that the series is complete.\n",

    "The iterator protocol isn't particularly difficult to understand and use, but it is also indisputable that the protocol is rather inconvenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main discomfort it brings is the need to save the state of the iteration between subsequent __iter__ invocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the Fib iterator is forced to precisely store the place in which the last invocation has been stopped (i.e., the evaluated number and the values of the two previous elements). This makes the code larger and less comprehensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why Python offers a much more effective, convenient, and elegant way of writing iterators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept is fundamentally based on a very specific and powerful mechanism provided by the yield keyword.\n",

    "You may think of the yield keyword as a smarter sibling of the return statement, with one essential difference.\n",

    "the inner() function returns the value of the variable accessible inside its scope, as inner() can use any of the entities at the disposal of outer()\n",
