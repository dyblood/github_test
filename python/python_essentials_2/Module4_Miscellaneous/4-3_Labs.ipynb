    "read(number) – reads the number characters/bytes from the file and returns them as a string; is able to read the whole file at once;\n",
    "readline() – reads a single line from the text file;\n",

    "\n",
    "write(string) – writes a string to a text file;\n",
    "write(bytearray) – writes all the bytes of bytearray to a file;\n",
