    "In this lesson we're going to prepare a simple text file with some short, simple content.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to show you some basic techniques you can utilize to read the file contents in order to process them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The processing will be very simple - you're going to copy the file's contents to the console, and count all the characters the program has read in.\n",
    "\n",
    "But remember - our understanding of a text file is very strict. In our sense, it's a plain text file - it may contain only text, without any additional decorations (formatting, different fonts, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why you should avoid creating the file using any advanced text processor like MS Word, LibreOffice Writer, or something like this. Use the very basics your OS offers: Notepad, vim, gedit, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your text files contain some national characters not covered by the standard ASCII charset, you may need an additional step. Your open() function invocation may require an argument denoting specific text encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you're using a Unix/Linux OS configured to use UTF-8 as a system-wide setting, the open() function may look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "stream = open('file.txt', 'rt', encoding='utf-8')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where the encoding argument has to be set to a value which is a string representing proper text encoding (UTF-8, here).\n",
    "\n",
    "Consult your OS documentation to find an encoding name adequate to your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of our experiments with file processing carried out in this section, we're going to use a pre-uploaded set of files (i.e., tzop.txt, or text.txt files) which you'll be able to work with. If you'd like to work with your own files locally on your machine, we strongly encourage you to do so, and to use IDLE (or any other IDE that you may prefer) to carry out your own tests."

    "\n",
    "This doesn't mean that these bytes cannot have their own meaning, or cannot represent any useful object, e.g., bitmap graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important aspect of this is that in the place where we have contact with the data, we are not able to, or simply don't want to, know anything about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amorphous data cannot be stored using any of the previously presented means - they are neither strings nor lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "There should be a special container able to handle such data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has more than one such container - one of them is a specialized class name bytearray - as the name suggests, it's an array containing (amorphous) bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to have such a container, e.g., in order to read in a bitmap image and process it in any way, you need to create it explicitly, using one of available constructors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look:\n",
    "\n",
    "data = bytearray(10)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "There is one important limitation - you mustn't set any byte array elements with a value which is not an integer (violating this rule will cause a TypeError exception) and you're not allowed to assign a value that doesn't come from the range 0 to 255 inclusive (unless you want to provoke a ValueError exception).\n",

    "How to read bytes from a stream\n",

    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "the method returns the number of successfully read bytes;\n",
    "the method tries to fill the whole space available inside its argument; if there are more data in the file than space in the argument, the read operation will stop before the end of the file; otherwise, the method's result may indicate that the byte array has only been filled fragmentarily (the result will show you that, too, and the part of the array not being used by the newly read contents remains untouched)\n",
