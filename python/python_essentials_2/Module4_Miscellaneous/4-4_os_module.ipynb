    "\n",
    "It's important to remember that the listdir function omits the entries '.' and '..', which are displayed, for example, when using the ls -a command on Unix systems. If the path isn't passed, the result will be returned for the current working directory.\n",

    "5. To move between directories, you can use a function called chdir(), which changes the current working directory to the specified path. As its argument, it takes any relative or absolute path.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to find out what the current working directory is, you can use the getcwd() function, which returns the path to it.\n",

    "6. To remove a directory, you can use the rmdir() function, but to remove a directory and its subdirectories, use the removedirs() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. On both Unix and Windows, you can use the system function, which executes a command passed to it as a string, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",

    "returned_value = os.system(\"mkdir hello\")\n",
    "\n",

    "The system function on Windows returns the value returned by shell after running the command given, while on Unix it returns the exit status of the process.\n",
