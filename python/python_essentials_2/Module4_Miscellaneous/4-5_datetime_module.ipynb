    "In this section, you'll learn about a Python module called datetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can guess, it provides classes for working with date and time. If you think you don't need to delve into this topic, let's talk about examples of using date and time in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Date and time have countless uses and it's probably hard to find a production application that doesn't use them. Here are some examples:\n",
    " - event logging — thanks to the knowledge of date and time, we are able to determine when exactly a critical error occurs in our application. When creating logs, you can specify the date and time format;\n",
    " - tracking changes in the database — sometimes it's necessary to store information about when a record was created or modified. The datetime module will be perfect for this case;\n",
    " - data validation — you'll soon learn how to read the current date and time in Python. Knowing the current date and time, we're able to validate various types of data, e.g., whether a discount coupon entered by a user in our application is still valid;\n",
    " - storing important information — can you imagine bank transfers without storing the information of when they were made? The date and time of certain actions must be preserved, and we must deal with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A snake and an hourglass\n",
    "\n",
    "Date and time are used in almost every area of our lives, so it's important to familiarize yourself with the Python datetime module. Are you ready for a new dose of knowledge?\n",

    "1. To create a date object, you must pass the year, month, and day arguments as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "from datetime import date\n",
    "\n",
    "my_date = date(2020, 9, 29)\n",
    "print(\"Year:\", my_date.year) # Year: 2020\n",
    "print(\"Month:\", my_date.month) # Month: 9\n",
    "print(\"Day:\", my_date.day) # Day: 29\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The date object has three (read-only) attributes: year, month, and day.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The today method returns a date object representing the current local date:\n",
    "\n",
    "from datetime import date\n",
    "print(\"Today:\", date.today()) # Displays: Today: 2020-09-29\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In Unix, the timestamp expresses the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC). This date is called the \"Unix epoch\", because it began the counting of time on Unix systems. The timestamp is actually the difference between a particular date (including time) and January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC), expressed in seconds. To create a date object from a timestamp, we must pass a Unix timestamp to the fromtimestamp method:\n",
    "\n",
    "from datetime import date\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "timestamp = time.time()\n",
    "d = date.fromtimestamp(timestamp)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The time function returns the number of seconds from January 1, 1970 to the current moment in the form of a float number.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The constructor of the time class accepts six arguments (hour, minute, second, microsecond, tzinfo, and fold). Each of these arguments is optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "from datetime import time\n",
    "\n",
    "t = time(13, 22, 20)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Hour:\", t.hour) # Hour: 13\n",
    "print(\"Minute:\", t.minute) # Minute: 22\n",
    "print(\"Second:\", t.second) # Second: 20\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The time module contains the sleep function, which suspends program execution for a given number of seconds, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "time.sleep(10)\n",
    "print(\"Hello world!\") # This text will be displayed after 10 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In the datetime module, date and time can be represented either as separate objects, or as one object. The class that combines date and time is called datetime. All arguments passed to the constructor go to read-only class attributes. They are year, month, day, hour, minute, second, microsecond, tzinfo, and fold:\n",
    "\n",
    "from datetime import datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "dt = datetime(2020, 9, 29, 13, 51)\n",
    "print(\"Datetime:\", dt) # Displays: Datetime: 2020-09-29 13:51:00\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The strftime method takes only one argument in the form of a string specifying a format that can consist of directives. A directive is a string consisting of the character % (percent) and a lowercase or uppercase letter. Below are some useful directives:\n",
    "\n",
    "%Y – returns the year with the century as a decimal number;\n",
    "%m – returns the month as a zero-padded decimal number;\n",
    "%d – returns the day as a zero-padded decimal number;\n",
    "%H – returns the hour as a zero-padded decimal number;\n",
    "%M – returns the minute as a zero-padded decimal number;\n",
    "%S – returns the second as a zero-padded decimal number.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "from datetime import date\n",
    "\n",
    "d = date(2020, 9, 29)\n",
    "print(d.strftime('%Y/%m/%d')) # Displays: 2020/09/29\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. It's possible to perform calculations on date and datetime objects, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "from datetime import date\n",
    "\n",
    "d1 = date(2020, 11, 4)\n",
    "d2 = date(2019, 11, 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "d = d1 - d2\n",
    "print(d) # Displays: 366 days, 0:00:00.\n",
    "print(d * 2) # Displays: 732 days, 0:00:00.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the subtraction is returned as a timedelta object that expresses the difference in days between the two dates in the example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the difference in hours, minutes, and seconds is also displayed. The timedelta object can be used for further calculations (e.g. you can multiply it by 2).\n",
