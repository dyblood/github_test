    "\n",
    "It's much easier to imagine that these numbers are stored in the disk file which is read by the program. The program sorts the numbers and doesn't send them to the screen, but instead creates a new file and saves the sorted sequence of numbers there.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to implement a simple database, the only way to store the information between program runs is to save it into a file (or files if your database is more complex).\n",

    "The last operation performed on a stream (this doesn't include the stdin, stdout, and stderr streams which don't require it) should be closing.\n",
    "\n",
    "That action is performed by a method invoked from within open stream object: stream.close().\n",
    "\n",
    " - the name of the function is definitely self-commenting: close()\n",
    " - the function expects exactly no arguments; the stream doesn't need to be opened\n",
    " - the function returns nothing but raises IOError exception in case of error;\n",
    " - most developers believe that the close() function always succeeds and thus there is no need to check if it's done its task properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This belief is only partly justified. If the stream was opened for writing and then a series of write operations were performed, it may happen that the data sent to the stream has not been transferred to the physical device yet (due to mechanism called caching or buffering).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Since the closing of the stream forces the buffers to flush them, it may be that the flushes fail and therefore the close() fails too.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already mentioned failures caused by functions operating with streams but not mentioned a word how exactly we can identify the cause of the failure.\n",

    "errno.EMFILE → Too many open files\n",

    "1. A file needs to be open before it can be processed by a program, and it should be closed when the processing is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opening the file associates it with the stream, which is an abstract representation of the physical data stored on the media. The way in which the stream is processed is called open mode. Three open modes exist:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - read mode – only read operations are allowed;\n",
    "    - write mode – only write operations are allowed;\n",
    "    - update mode – both writes and reads are allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Depending on the physical file content, different Python classes can be used to process files. In general, the BufferedIOBase is able to process any file, while TextIOBase is a specialized class dedicated to processing text files (i.e. files containing human-visible texts divided into lines using new-line markers). Thus, the streams can be divided into binary and text ones.\n",
    "\n",

    "3. The following open() function syntax is used to open a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "open(file_name, mode=open_mode, encoding=text_encoding)\n",
    "\n",
    "The invocation creates a stream object and associates it with the file named file_name, using the specified open_mode and setting the specified text_encoding, or it raises an exception in the case of an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Three predefined streams are already open when the program starts:\n",
    "    - sys.stdin – standard input;\n",
    "    - sys.stdout – standard output;\n",
    "    - sys.stderr – standard error output.\n",
    "\n",
