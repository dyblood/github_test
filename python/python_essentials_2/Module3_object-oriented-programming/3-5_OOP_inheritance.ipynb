    "\n",
    "Let's define the term for our purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a common practice (in object programming) of passing attributes and methods from the superclass (defined and existing) to a newly created class, called the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, inheritance is a way of building a new class, not from scratch, but by using an already defined repertoire of traits. The new class inherits (and this is the key) all the already existing equipment, but is able to add some new ones if needed.\n",

    "Thanks to that, it's possible to build more specialized (more concrete) classes using some sets of predefined general rules and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important factor of the process is the relation between the superclass and all of its subclasses (note: if B is a subclass of A and C is a subclass of B, this also means than C is a subclass of A, as the relationship is fully transitive).\n",

    "How to build a hierarchy of classes: continued\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is not the only way of constructing adaptable classes. You can achieve the same goals (not always, but very often) by using a technique named composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition is the process of composing an object using other different objects. The objects used in the composition deliver a set of desired traits (properties and/or methods) so we can say that they act like blocks used to build a more complicated structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be said that:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - inheritance extends a class's capabilities by adding new components and modifying existing ones; in other words, the complete recipe is contained inside the class itself and all its ancestors; the object takes all the class's belongings and makes use of them;\n",
    "   - composition projects a class as a container able to store and use other objects (derived from other classes) where each of the objects implements a part of a desired class's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us illustrate the difference by using the previously defined vehicles. The previous approach led us to a hierarchy of classes in which the top-most class was aware of the general rules used in turning the vehicle, but didn't know how to control the appropriate components (wheels or tracks).\n",
    "\n",
    "The subclasses implemented this ability by introducing specialized mechanisms. Let's do (almost) the same thing, but using composition. The class - like in the previous example - is aware of how to turn the vehicle, but the actual turn is done by a specialized object stored in a property named controller. The controller is able to control the vehicle by manipulating the relevant vehicle's parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look into the editor - this is how it could look.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two classes named Tracks and Wheels - they know how to control the vehicle's direction. There is also a class named Vehicle which can use any of the available controllers (the two already defined, or any other defined in the future) - the controller itself is passed to the class during initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, the vehicle's ability to turn is composed using an external object, not implemented inside the Vehicle class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we have a universal vehicle and can install either tracks or wheels onto it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code produces the following output:\n",
