    "\n",
    "As you already know, a method is a function embedded inside a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one fundamental requirement - a method is obliged to have at least one parameter (there are no such thing as parameterless methods - a method may be invoked without an argument, but not declared without parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first (or only) parameter is usually named self. We suggest that you follow the convention - it's commonly used, and you'll cause a few surprises by using other names for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name self suggests the parameter's purpose - it identifies the object for which the method is invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're going to invoke a method, you mustn't pass the argument for the self parameter - Python will set it for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example in the editor shows the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "method\n",
    "output\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the way we've created the object - we've treated the class name like a function, returning a newly instantiated object of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want the method to accept parameters other than self, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "   # place them after self in the method's definition;\n",
    "   # deliver them during invocation without specifying self (as previously)\n",
