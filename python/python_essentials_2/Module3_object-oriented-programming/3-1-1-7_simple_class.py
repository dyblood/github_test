class TheSimplestClass:
    pass # pass keyword fills the class with nothing

my_first_object = TheSimplestClass() # creating an object named my_first_object

# act of creating an object of the selected class is called INSTANTIATION
    # as the object becomes an instance of the class

# NOTE: the class name tries to pretend that it's a function
#       the newly created object is equipped with everything with everything the class brings;
#       as this class is completely empty, the object is empty, too.


#objects are equipped with:
    # name - identifies them and allows us to distinguish between them
    # set of properties - (the set can be empty)
    # set of methods - (can be set to empty)
